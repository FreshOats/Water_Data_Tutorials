# Water_Data_Tutorials
This repository hosts the necessary data as well as Jupyter files for the SQL tutorials published on Medium.

- Tutorials are titled appropriately, and are in the main directory
- Datasets folder contains all data needed for the tutorials. 
- Outlines folder contains rough drafts and incomplete tutorials. 

The tutorials published in Medium are copied from the ipynb files with the same titles, and can be used as stand-alone tutorials if someone does not have access to the Medium.com articles. 

If you have not used any of these tutorials, you should start by accessing the __Create_Database_SQL_Code file, which contains the tSQL code to create and populate the database used for all tutorials in this REPO. The data are contained in the common_toxins.csv and state_regulations.csv.  The mcls_dlrs_phgs is the document that explains the parameters associated with the tables, as provided by the California government.

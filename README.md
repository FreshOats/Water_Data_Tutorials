# Water_Data_Tutorials
This repository hosts the necessary data as well as Jupyter files for the SQL tutorials published on Medium. The Datasets folder contains all data needed for the tutorials. The Outlines folder contains rough drafts and incomplete tutorials. The tutorials published in Medium are copied from the ipynb files with the same titles, and can be used as stand-alone tutorials if someone does not have access to the Medium.com articles.
